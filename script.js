//TODO 📕 Module 06 - Loops, Iteration and High Order Array Methods - Lesson 02: for Loop


//TODO 📝 Step 1: Theoretical Aspects

//* 📘 A. In-Depth Exposition

//? 🔹 What is a for loop?
//  A "for" loop is a control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. It's ideal when:
//  • You know exactly how many times you need to repeat something.
//  • You are working with arrays or iterable data where indexes matter.

//? 🔹 Syntax Breakdown:
//  The for loop contains three parts inside parentheses:
//  1. Initialization (e.g., let i = 0);
//  2. Condition (e.g., i < 5);
//  3. Final Expression (e.g., i++).

//  Together, these define the loop's lifecycle:
//  • Initialize → Check condition → Run block → Update → Repeat

//* 📚 B. Contextual Understanding

//? 🔸 Why use for loops?
//  • To traverse arrays when index-based logic is needed.
//  • To perform repeated calculations or tasks like rendering UI elements, checking values, or logging information.
//  • They are especially useful when performance and low-level control are priorities.

//? 🔸 When not to use a for loop:
//  • When you want functional, declarative code (.map(), .filter() are often preferred for clarity).
//  • When the operation doesn’t depend on an index (then for...of or .forEach() might be better).

//* 🕰️ C. Historical Perspective

//  • The for loop has been a core feature of JavaScript since its inception.
//  • It’s inherited from C-like languages and remains widely used in systems where deterministic control and efficiency are critical.
//  • While modern JavaScript offers expressive alternatives, for loops are still essential in many frameworks and performance-intensive scenarios.

//* ✅ D. Best Practices and Pitfalls

//? ✔ Best Practices:
//  • Use let for the loop counter (let i = 0) to avoid leaking variables into the outer scope.
//  • Keep the loop body small and focused — minimize side effects.
//  • Use break or return strategically to exit early when necessary.

//? ⚠ Common Pitfalls:
//  • Forgetting to increment the counter — leads to infinite loops.
//  • Using var — can cause scope confusion due to function-level scoping.
//  • Looping beyond the bounds of an array — causes undefined errors.

//* 🔄 E. Real-World Analogies
//? Concept                             Analogy
//  for loop                            Repeating a recipe step 5 times
//  Initialization                      Setting the oven temperature
//  Condition                           Checking the timer has not run out
//  Final Expression                    Moving on to the next tray or page
//  The "for" loop structure mirrors task repetition in everyday routines.

//* 🧩 F. Segmented Learning (Subtopics in this Lesson)
//  1. Basic "for" loop syntax and flow
//  2. Index-controlled iteration over arrays
//  3. Nested "for" loops for matrix/grid traversal
//  4. Use of break and continue inside loops
//  5. Comparisons with other loop types


//TODO  🔍 Step 2: Inquiry & Application

//* 🧠 1. Guided Inquiry-Based Learning
//  Let’s deepen your understanding of the for loop by working through some conceptual prompts. Reflect on your reasoning, not just the syntax.

//? 🔎 Exploration Prompts:

//  • Why might you choose a for loop over .map() or .forEach() when working with arrays?
//! Answer: We use a "for" loop to avoid leaking variables into the outer scope. minimize side effects and and is much easier to read the index.
//  • need to manipulate or skip specific indices
//  • plan to exit early (break, return)
//  • need performance tuning

//  • How do the three parts of a for loop (initialization, condition, update) interact logically to form the loop’s flow?
//! Answer: The "for" loop can lead to infinite loops if the developer forgets to increment the counter and uses break or return strategically to exit early when necessary.
//  • Initialization: sets the starting point
//  • Condition: is checked before each loop run
//  • Update: adjusts the loop state after each iteration
// When mismanaged, these can lead to runaway loops or skipped logic.

//  • What happens if you accidentally place the increment outside the loop block?
//! Answer: Looping beyond the bounds of an array causes undefined errors, infinite loops or skipped elements. Also, if I am working with arrays, it could lead to out-of-bound errors or performance bugs. 

//? ⚖️ Critical Thinking Scenario:

//  Imagine this situation: You are building a web app that paginates items and displays 10 products per page. You want to loop through the correct segment of an array based on the current page number.
//* Question:   How might a "for" loop offer better control here than .map() or .forEach()?
//! Answer:     The main difference between a "for" loop and the map() method is that a for loop allows for more control over the iteration process. In contrast, the map() method provides a more concise and functional way to transform elements of an array into a new array.
//  • .map() always touches every item
//  • for loop gives precise start and stop control, ideal for slicing arrays into visible chunks
//  When working with pageIndex, item limits, or lazy loading, for loops shine.

//? 🎯 Practical Thinking Prompt:

//  You are building a quiz app. You want to loop over a set of questions and stop once the user gets one wrong.
//* Question:   How can the "for" loop be adapted to exit early in such a case? (Hint: think about the break keyword.)
//! Answer:     I might already know this, but a "for" loop can be stopped using the break keyword. If using a "for" loop to iterate over an array until I can find a specific item or a certain number of iterations have run, I can stop the loop by executing break in the loop.

//* 💡 2. Hands-On Reflection Prompts

//  Here are some “think-before-you-code” exercises to prepare you for implementation:
//  1. Loop Planning Thought Exercise:
//  • Design a loop that logs all even numbers from 2 to 20. What will your initialization, condition, and update look like?
//! Answer: 

for (let i = 2; i <= 20; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(i);;
    }
}

//  2. Nested Loop Thinking:
//  Question:   Imagine you are rendering a 5x5 grid for a game board. How many loops do you need? What are the outer and inner loops responsible for?
//! Answer:  To render a 5x5 grid for a board game, I need 2 nested loops.
//  • One to iterate over rows (outer loop)
//  • One to iterate over columns within each row (inner loop)
//  💡 Use this rule of thumb: 1 loop per dimension → A 2D grid = 2 loops.

//  3. Performance Awareness Prompt:
//  Question:   How would you optimize a "for" loop if it is processing a massive array (e.g., 1 million elements)?
//! Answer: Since the loop variable i is manually handled, the memory overhead is minimal. The length of the array (arr.length) is calculated on each iteration, which can be slightly inefficient in cases where the array length is large and remains constant throughout the loop. However, storing arr.length in a variable before the loop can mitigate this problem.
//  • Avoid unnecessary recalculations inside the loop
//  • Minimize memory reads
//  • Use let len = arr.length; before the loop when .length won't change

//* 🧠 3. Solo Discussion Reflection

//  Consider talking through:
//  Question: What surprised you about how for loops behave?
//! Answer: The fact that if someone forget to include in the code break or return the program will leads to infinite loops. While break and return are not required in every for loop, forgetting to update the loop variable or writing a condition that never becomes false is what leads to infinite loops.

//  Question: What kind of bugs could happen if you misplace the condition or increment?
//! Answer: If we misplaced the condition or increment can causes undefined errors.
//  • If a loop goes beyond the array’s bounds, will get undefined values.
//  • If accidentally increment incorrectly, the loop might:
//      • Skip elements
//      • Miss the stopping condition
//      • Or trigger unexpected output
//  Best practice: always double-check loop boundaries when iterating over arrays.

//  Question: Can I explain how a "for" loop works to someone without showing them code?
//! Answer: At this moment is not so easy for me to explain the code, because I do not have enough knowledge and experience. A "for" loop is like a recipe step that runs multiple times. First, I set a starting point. Then, decide when to stop. Each time, I must prepare for the next round.
