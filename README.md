# 📕 Module 06 - Loops, Iteration and High Order Array Methods - Lesson 02.01: `for` Loop

This lesson focuses on how to use the `for` loop in JavaScript to perform repeated operations, iterate over data, and control program flow.

## 🧠 Step 1: Theoretical Aspects

### 🔹 What is a `for` loop?
A `for` loop is a control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code a known number of times. It contains three main parts:
- **Initialization** – set the starting value of the loop variable
- **Condition** – determines whether the loop continues
- **Update** – modifies the loop variable after each iteration

### 🔹 Use Cases
- Iterating over arrays
- Counting or tallying values
- Building sequences
- Applying logic repeatedly within a known range

## 🔍 Step 2: Inquiry & Application

### Key Questions Explored:
- When is a `for` loop better than `.map()` or `.forEach()`?
- How do the three loop components interact?
- How does `break` or `continue` affect a loop?

### Thought Exercises:
- Printing even numbers
- Reversing iteration
- Nested loop planning
- Performance considerations for large arrays

---

## ✅ Step 3: Assessment & Feedback

- Completed a 10-question quiz (score: 10/10)
- Reflected on loop clarity, common bugs, and analogy-based explanations
- Identified confidence growth and remaining questions about optional loop parts

---

## 🔁 Step 4: Reflection & Discussion

### Instructor Prompts Answered:
- When is a `for` loop more appropriate than `.map()`?
- Real-life use cases imagined (e.g., countdown, pagination)
- Explained `for` loop to a younger self using analogies like eating apples in a basket

## 🧩 Step 5: Exercises

### Core Exercises Completed:
1. Log numbers from 1 to 10
2. Print even numbers from 1 to 50
3. Reverse print 10 to 1
4. Sum numbers 1 to 100
5. Log array items with index
6. Print every third number from 3 to 30
7. Stop when a specific value (42) is found
8. Print a 3x3 grid using nested loops
9. Build a multiplication table for 5
10. Paginate an array of 100 items by page number

## 🛠️ Step 6: Project Integration

**Flashcard App Feature:**
- Loop through flashcards and stop when one is marked as `mastered`
- Used a `for` loop with `break` for early exit
- Demonstrated logic control and conditional execution in a real-world learning app

---

## 🧾 Step 7: Exit Ticket Questions

### Final Reflections:
- Clear understanding of how `for` loops repeat code
- Gained awareness that loop parts are optional
- Able to explain a loop metaphorically as a repetitive task like “checking every item on a list”
